# Chatbot with NLTK 🤖

A simple text-based chatbot built using Python's NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The chatbot uses predefined patterns and responses to have basic conversations with the user. 

## Features ✨
- **Basic Conversations**: Greets, responds to simple questions, and provides basic assistance.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Uses NLTK's regular expressions to match user input and generate appropriate responses.
- **Easy to Extend**: Add more conversation patterns and responses to enhance the chatbot's capabilities.

## Installation 🔧

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):  
   Download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install NLTK**:  
   Run the following command in your terminal to install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

1. **Clone or Download the Project**:  
   Clone this repository or download the Python file `chatbot.py`.

2. **Run the Script**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `chatbot.py` is saved, and run:
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Start Chatting**:  
   The chatbot will ask how it can assist you. Type your questions and interact with it. Type `quit` to exit the conversation.

- You can add more **patterns** and **responses** in the `pairs` list to make the chatbot more interactive and intelligent.
- Modify the **reflections** dictionary to handle different ways of phrasing the same sentence.

## Technologies Used 🛠

- **Python**: The programming language used to build the chatbot.
